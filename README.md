# DraftApprove

DraftApprove is a Ruby gem which lets you save draft changes of your ActiveRecord models to your database. It allows grouping of related changes into a 'Draft Transaction' which must be approved or rejected as a whole, rather than allowing individual draft changes to be applied independently.

There are a number of other similar Ruby gems available for drafting changes to ActiveRecord models. Depending upon your projects needs, another gem may be more suitable. See the [Alternative Drafting Gems](#alternative_drafting_gems) section for full details.

The specific features / functionality offered by DraftApprove are:

* No changes are needed to your existing database tables
* No updates are required to your existing ActiveRecord queries or raw SQL queries
* It is possible to save drafts of new records, save draft changes to existing records, and save draft deletions of records
* Multiple related draft changes (new records, updates, deletions) may be grouped together in a 'Draft Transaction' which must then be approved or rejected as a whole
* Each model may only have one pending draft at a time

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'draft_approve'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install draft_approve

Once installed, you must generate the migration to create the required draft tables in your database, and run the migration:

```
$ rails generate draft_approve:migration
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Alternative Drafting Gems

* [Drafting](https://github.com/ledermann/drafting)
* [DraftPunk](https://github.com/stevehodges/draftpunk)
* [Draftsman](https://github.com/jmfederico/draftsman)

**DraftPunk** and **Draftsman** both require changes to your existing database tables. In itself, this is not a problem, however this also _potentially_ requires changes to your ActiveRecord Queries and any raw SQL you may be executing in order to ensure draft models or draft changes are not accidentally returned by queries or shown to end users.

This problem can be avoided using default scopes on your models. This may be a suitable solution for new projects, or projects which don't utilise much or any raw SQL queries.

See the [DraftPunk documentation](https://github.com/stevehodges/draftpunk#what-about-the-rest-of-the-application-people-are-seeing-draft-businesses) and [Draftsman documentation](https://github.com/jmfederico/draftsman#drafted-item-scopes) on using scopes.

**Drafting** does not require any modifications to existing tables, and therefore has no risk of existing queries accidentally returning draft data. However, [it only allows saving drafts on records which are not persisted yet](https://github.com/ledermann/drafting#hints). This may be suitable for projects where it is not necessary to create and approve draft updates to objects.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
