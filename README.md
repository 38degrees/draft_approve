# DraftApprove

DraftApprove is a Ruby gem which lets you save draft changes of your ActiveRecord models to your database. It allows grouping of related changes into a 'Draft Transaction' which must be approved or rejected as a whole, rather than allowing individual draft changes to be applied independently.

## Alternative Drafting Gems

There are a number of other similar Ruby gems available for drafting changes to ActiveRecord models. Depending upon your projects needs, another gem may be more suitable. The specific features / functionality offered by DraftApprove are:

* No changes are needed to your existing database tables
* No updates are required to your existing ActiveRecord queries or raw SQL queries
* It is possible to save drafts of new records, save draft changes to existing records, and save draft deletions of records
* Multiple related draft changes (new records, updates, deletions) may be grouped together in a 'Draft Transaction' which must then be approved or rejected as a whole
* Each model may only have one pending draft at a time

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'draft_approve'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install draft_approve

Once installed, you must generate the migration to create the required draft tables in your database:

    $ rails generate draft_approve:migration

And finally run the new migration:

    $ rails db:migrate
